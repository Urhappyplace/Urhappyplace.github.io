<h1>My Journal</h1>


<h2>10/1/24</h2>
<p>This is my first ever journal entry and I would like to say that this website is absolute dogwater. <br>No color, nothing located in the projects page. This is the only content on the website itself. <br>So it sucks. I want to try to make a drop down text box, where it will show more text when <br>a button is clicked. And it requires a ton of css. So imma try to do it myself.</p>

<h2>10/2/24</h2>
<p>Today I had to work on my index page, which personally went very well.<br> I was able to make a logo(which I made before), and attempted to make a menu bar. Sort of.<br> So now its a rectangle with curved coners and two pieces of text.<br> And the logo can go back to the index page. That is currently only on the index page, as<br> I have not put it on any other pages yet. And I wanted to make it so that the menu bar scrolls,<br> and then when it reaches to top of the page it stays fixed. So yeah. Working on that soon.</p>
